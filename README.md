# Automated_door_lock
This code controls a automated door lock that can be controlled using bluetooth, IR remotes, proximity sensors and mechanical switches.
Sending a 'q' serially via bluetooth to the door will open the door
Using a TV remote the lock can be trained to open for a particular signal
The door will open when somebody want to go out of the door and comes near the door
Future work includes making a door opener and adding SIM card functionality to lock the door from far away by sending a msg or giving a call.
